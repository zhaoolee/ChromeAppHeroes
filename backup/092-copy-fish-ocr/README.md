Copy, paste and translate text from images or videos with this free OCR software Chrome extension

Do you need to copy and paste text from images or videos? If yes, then the Copyfish free OCR software is for you.

“Images” come in all kinds of forms: photographs, charts, diagrams, screenshots, PDF documents, comics, error messages, memes – and Youtube movies.

Common reasons to convert images to text are if you want to google it, store it, email it or translate it. Until now, your only option was to retype the text. 

For language learners: There are many translator addons available, but they only work with plain website text. Text inside images, in the form of tricky Javascript/AJAX or, especially, in the form of movie subtitles on Youtube or Youku is unreachable for them. But not for Copyfish. And if you want, Copyfish also translates the text for you right away. Especially for the subtitle translation use case, Copyfish has a repeat feature. Mark the area of the subtitle once and then use the repeat button to grab the text from this area repeatable as you watch the movie. Clearly, that function was inspired by the Chinese Pinyin subtitle translator app, from the same author. Copyfish replaces this app with a cross-platform solution.

For developers: Copyfish is published under an open-source (GPL) license. As OCR software, Copyfish uses the free OCR API on https://ocr.space/.
